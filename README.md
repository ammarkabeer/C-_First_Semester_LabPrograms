# C++ First Semester Lab Codes

This repository contains my **C++ lab codes and practice programs** from the **first semester**.
The goal is to practice programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and coding style in C++.

##  Topics Covered

* Basics of C++ (input/output, variables, data types)
* Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `switch`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
* Functions and Recursion
* Arrays and Strings
* Pointers
